		<p> Sea Otters are really great animals. Why? I mean, have you looked at them? Do you have a soul? If you're still reading this, you obviously agree, and if you agree, you obviously want to learn more about these adorable little creatures. Right? Right. 
		
		<h2> WHAT DO SEA OTTERS EAT?</h2>
		
		<p>The better question is, what <i>don't</i> sea otters eat? These little cuties eat approximately 25% of their weight in food each day - and they have expensive taste. A sea otter's diet consists mainly of urchins, mussels, abalone, clams, smails, crabs, among many other marine species. Why do they eat so much? Because they have the metabolism of a 13 year old boy and need to stuff their faces everyday just to support it.</p>

		<h2> WHERE DO SEA OTTERS LIVE?</h2>

		<p> Well for starters, the sea. Obviously. But if we're getting specific, think the Pacific. The majority of sea otters live in shallow coastal waters off the northern Pacific. Sea otters are quite fond of the coasts of: 
			<li> Canada </li>
			<li> Russia </li>
			<li> Japan </li>
			<li> California </li>
			<li> Washington </li>
			<li> Alaska </li>
