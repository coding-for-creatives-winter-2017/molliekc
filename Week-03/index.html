		<h3> WHAT DO SEA OTTERS EAT?</h2>
		<img class="otter-pic center img-responsive" src="https://www.aquablog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2012-01-18-Tanu-eats-a-crab-Meighan-Makarchuk-46.jpg" alt="sea-otter-eating-crab" width="500">
		
		<p>The better question is, what <i>don't</i> sea otters eat? These little cuties eat approximately 25% of their weight in food each day - and they have expensive taste. A sea otter's diet consists mainly of urchins, mussels, abalone, clams, smails, crabs, among many other marine species. Why do they eat so much? Because they have the metabolism of a 13 year old boy and need to stuff their faces everyday just to support it.</p>

		<h3> WHERE DO SEA OTTERS LIVE?</h2>
		<img class="otter-pic center img-responsive" src="http://www.seaotters.org/information/uploads/2013/02/Michaelbaird1-1147x604.jpg" alt=sea-otters-in-kelp" width="500">

		<p> Well for starters, the sea. Obviously. But if we're getting specific, think the Pacific. The majority of sea otters live in shallow coastal waters off the northern Pacific.Sea otters are quite fond of the coasts of: 
			<br> Canada 
			<br> Russia 
			<br> Japan 
			<br> California 
			<br> Washington 
			<br> Alaska

		<h3> WHAT DO SEA OTTERS LIKE TO DO?</h2>

		<p> For the most part, sea otters are pretty easy going mammals. They enjoy lying on their backs and simply floating on the water's surface, or in kelp forests or giant seaweed. They also sleep and eat in this position. Otters are very social creatures, so when they aren't just floating around, they're spending quality time with their other otter pals.</p> 

		<h3> WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT OTTERS? </h4>
		<img class="otter-pic center img-responsive" src="http://www.defendersblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sea-otters-Michael-Peters-dpc.jpg"alt="two-sea-otters" width="500">

		<p> Aside from the fact that they're adorable, otters are also a keystone species. This means that their existence helps to protect the envioronment and their ecosystem. See, sea otters dine on sea urchins and other invertebrates that are notorious for grazing on giant kelp. Without sea otters and they're aggressive diet, kelp forests would be destroyed. A large variety of animals rely on kelp forests for the very existence. Kelp forests also help protect us humans from harmful carbon dioxide, as well as coastlines from storms. 

		<h3> <mark>HOW TO PROTECT SEA OTTERS </h3>

		<p> Unfortunately, due to the fur trade and pollution, the sea otter population has declined over the years, dropping from more than a million to only 106,000 worldwide. Thankfully, there are ways we can all help!
